The issue can be solved by several methods:

**1. Re-evaluate Selectors:**  Consider if the class `.container` is truly necessary for this style or if the styles in `#myDiv.container` can be moved to another, more appropriate selector that won't cause unexpected overriding.

**2. Use !important (Use with caution):**  The `!important` flag will make the styles always apply, regardless of specificity. Use this with great caution, as it can make your CSS difficult to maintain and debug.

**3. Refactor CSS (Best Practice):** Restructuring the CSS to avoid the conflict entirely would be the most sustainable approach.  This might involve rethinking the class structure to better represent the hierarchy of your elements.

Example Refactor (bugSolution.css):

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

#myDiv {
  color: green;
}

/* No longer needs to override #myDiv with higher specificity*/
#myDiv.container {
  /* Removed - style moved elsewhere */
}
```

By carefully considering specificity and using more organized CSS, these types of unexpected style overrides can be avoided.
